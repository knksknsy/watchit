Introduction:
Watchit is an app to organize your favourite movies in lists and discover new movies. 
We built everything according to the MEAN stack with an Angular 2 client and a Node backend with connected MongoDB

Setup:
Assuming you have installed and setup Docker, just run docker-compose build (could take a few moments) and docker-compose up. Afterwards use your favourite browser and type "localhost" into the address field. Done.
